Appropriateness & Support:

There are two important metrics for "goodness" of a hospital which are based on different things.   
Since the ultimate purpose of this list is unknown, it is useful to provide end users both lists
so they can decide which is better for themselves.  Since there is no overlap between lists, they're
clearly measuring different aspects of the hospitals.
