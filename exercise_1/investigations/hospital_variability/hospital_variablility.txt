Original Question:

Which procedures have the greatest variablility between hospitals?

Conclusion:

The following procedures are the most variable outcomes across hospitals:

Count   Average StDev	Procedure Name
48888	274.0	93.0	ED1
48706	99.0	61.0	ED2
46606	145.0	41.0	OP 18
5810	61.0	35.0	Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention
13412	68.0	22.0	Head CT results
12306	84.0	21.0	Thrombolytic Therapy
1036	71.0	18.0	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival
44296	55.0	18.0	Median time to pain med
8092	88.0	18.0	Discharge instructions
46634	28.0	17.0	Door to diagnostic eval


Appropriateness & Support:

In this case, the variablility between procedures is almost nonexistent when measured by the readmission score metric.  
Thus, using only the effective care metric is appropriate in this situation.   

As shown in the table, the effective care score's standard deviation by procedure indicates a few procedures which are particularly 
variable (the emergency room ones, in particular) and they "normalize" to being similar to one-another.
