Original Question:

Which states are models of high-quality care?

Conclusion:

The following states are models of high-quality care:

Based on Effective Care Score
Count	AvScore	State
3612	103.0	DC
3164	100.0	DE
18102	100.0	MD
73346	97.0	NY
32452	97.0	NJ
137816	96.0	CA
11088	96.0	NV
13608	95.0	CT
27552	95.0	MA
8792	95.0	NH



Appropriateness & Support:

In this case, the readmissions score doesn't vary at all between the top hospitals, which removes most of its utility.
Thus, states were evaluated on effective care scores alone.

This metric is appropriate because it is measured across many procedures and many hospitals within the states.
